# pingpongAI

Creating a ping pong game using reinforcement learning. Used Deep Q Networks ( 5 layered CNN model ) which took in a snapshot of the ping pong board environment as the input - the pixels of the image. The output will be the action the agent paddle is supposed to take - either stay in the same position, go up or alternatively go down.
